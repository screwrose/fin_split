# matrix calculator for arbitrary sized matrices

Given task for semestrial project:
Implement a class Matrix that represents a fully-functioning matrix arithmetic. 
The class must be able to execute all basic matrix operations: sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, determinant calculation. 
Intrinsically, the matrix is represented by a dynamic two-dimensional array of floating-point numbers. The class must have the following members:

default constructor; 
constructor with parameters; 
copy constructor; destructor; 
overloaded assignment operator; 
overloaded arithmetical operators: +, -, *, /; 
overloaded stream extraction >> and insertion operators <<; 
determinant;
matrix inversion;
